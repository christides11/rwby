# How to install samples

Unity provides  the **Unity Toon Shader** sample scenes for the three render pipelines. Please install a set of samples fits the render pipeline you use.

1. Make sure that [Render pipeline](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.2/Documentation/Manual/render-pipelines.html) you want to use installed and set up before installing the UTS samples for each. 
1. Open the [Package Manager window](https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.2/Documentation/Manual/Packages.html).
1. Click **Unity Toon Shader** in the left side of the window.
1. Press **Import** in the right side of the window.
1. Set Graphics Pipeline Asset in the [Project Setting window](#https://docs.unity3d.com/2022.2/Documentation/Manual/comp-ManagerGroup.html).  URP samples require `UTS2URPPipelineAsset`. Whereas HDRP samples require  `HDRenderPipelineAsset_UTS`.
