# Requirements and compatibility

## Requirements

Because The **Unity Toon Shader** is ready for all the render pipelines, please referrer to each render pipeline requirement doc to see specific hardware and software requirements. The use of linear color space is strongly recommended.


## Unity Render Pipeline compatibility
The **Unity Toon Shader** is compatible with all the render pipelines, the **Built-in Render Pipeline**, **Universal Render Pipeline (URP)** and **High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP)**.  Still, there are some differences in the features supported by different render pipelines. Please refer to the Feature difference for each render pipeline for details.


## Unity Editor compatibility

**Unity Toon Shader**  0.8.x-preview works for Unity 2020.3, 2021.3 to 2022.2. As some functions aren't available, supporting 2021.1, 2021.2 are impossible.
