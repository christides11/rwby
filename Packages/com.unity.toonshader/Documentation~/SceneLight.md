# Scene Light Effectiveness Settings

The **Unity Toon Shader** provides the way to control effectiveness of lights in the scene per material. There are times when you want to eliminate or limit the effect of lighting on a material type.
UTS allows you to control each area color regardless of the actual light color. While this feature is fundamental to professional cell shading, sometimes it's necessary to apply actual light colors. 
UTS provides a way to determine if the actual light color does or doesn't affect it.
