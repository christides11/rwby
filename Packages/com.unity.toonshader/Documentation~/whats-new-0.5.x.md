## HDRP AOV

From version 0.5.x, the **Unity Toon Shader** is compatible with HDRP **Arbitrary Output Variables** (AOV). This means you can now record Beauty, Albedo, Normal, and other AOV sequential images using Recorder version 3.0 or later.

When you use HDRP AOV, you need to disable [Outline](Outline.md). For more information, refer to [Known Issues](Known-issue.md).
